//Searching in Binary Tree
import java.util.LinkedList;

/*
 * Searching for a value in a binary tree means looking through the tree to find a node that has that value.
 * Since binary trees do not have a specific order like binary search trees, we typically use any traversal method to search.
 * The most common methods are depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).
 * In DFS, we start from the root and explore the depth nodes first.
 * In BFS, we explore all the nodes at the present depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next level.
 * We continue this process until we either find the node with the desired value or reach the end of the tree.
 * If the tree is empty or the value isnâ€™t found after exploring all possibilities, 
 * we conclude that the value does not exist in the tree.
